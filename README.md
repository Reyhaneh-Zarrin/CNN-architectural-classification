### Architectural Heritage Elements Image64 Dataset Project

This repository contains my solution for the Architectural Heritage Elements Image64 Dataset assignment. The project involves working with a dataset of 10,235 images categorized into ten architectural elements (Altar, Apse, Bell tower, Column, Dome [inner], Dome [outer], Flying buttress, Gargoyle [and Chimera], Stained glass, and Vault).

The objectives of the project are threefold:

- **CNN Model Training:** Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images, involving data preprocessing, CNN architecture design, and model optimization.
- **Deconvolution Visualization:** Implement deconvolution techniques to visualize the CNNâ€™s feature maps and understand how the model interprets the input images.
- **Image Generation:** Manipulate the trained model to generate images corresponding to specific classes.

This project provided practical experience in handling image data, building and optimizing CNN models, and applying visualization techniques to understand deep learning processes.
